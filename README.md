# Microsoft Teams App Camp 2022

This hands-on experience will lead developers through the steps needed to take an existing SaaS app from "zero Microsoft" to a complete Teams app running in the Teams app store. 

In this series of labs, you will port a simple "Northwind Orders" web application to become a full-fledged Microsoft Teams application. To make the app understandable by a wide audience, it is written in vanilla JavaScript with no UI framework, however it does use modern browser capabilities such as web components, CSS variables, and ECMAScript modules. The server side is also in JavaScript, using Express, the most popular web server platform for NodeJS.

There are two options for doing the labs:

* The "A" path is for developers with apps that are already based on Azure Active Directory. The starting app uses Azure Active Directory and the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL).
**[START HERE](./lab-instructions/aad/A01-begin-app.md) for the "A" path**

* the "B" path is for developers with apps that use some other identity system. It includes a simple (and not secure!) cookie-based auth system based on the Employees table in the Northwind database. You will use an identity mapping scheme to allow your existing users to log in directly or via Azure AD Single Sign-On.
**[START HERE](./lab-instructions/bespoke/B01-begin-app.md) for the "B" path**

Links to resources referenced throughout App Camp can be found [here, on the Resources page](./docs/Resources.md).

## Summary

Both paths have the following labs:

1. Set up the starting application (outside of Teams)
2. ("B" path only) - Get the application working in Teams with the existing authentication
3. Make the app work with Azure AD SSO in Microsoft Teams
4. Update the app styling to match Microsoft Teams
5. Add a configurable tab so your app works in group chats and Teams channels
6. Add a messaging extension with adaptive cards
7. Use Microsoft Graph, a task module, and deep linking to initiate a chat with a business user
8. Install a sample licensing service and App Source simulator and add licensing to your app to learn about app monetization

## Prerequisites

This lab is intended for developers. Most of the labs don't assume a lot of specialzed knowledge; coding is  in JavaScript without use of specialized frameworks or libraries. But if you're not comfortable with coding, you may find it a bit challenging.

Technical prerequisites are explained [in the repo wiki](https://github.com/OfficeDev/m365-msteams-northwind-app-samples/wiki/Prerequisites)
