# Deep linking

## Summary

This sample is an enhancement of the personal tab created from using the core teams application built over the course of labs [A01](../../../../lab-instructions/aad/A01-begin-app.md)-[A03](../../../../lab-instructions/aad/A03-after-apply-styling.md).

In this sample, the student gets to explore deep linking in Microsoft Teams.

Copy the url to a particular order in `My orders` tab of the user. 

This link can then be shared via chat or email.
Another user can open this url to view the order details in their own personal tab.
