## Minimal Path to Awesome

### Authorize Microsoft Teams to log users into your application

Microsoft Teams provides a Single Sign-On (SSO) capability so users are silently logged into your application using the same credentials they used to log into Microsoft Teams. This requires giving Microsoft Teams permission to issue Azure AD tokens on behalf of your application. In this exercise, you'll provide that permission.

#### App registration

Go to the [Azure AD admin portal](https://aad.portal.azure.com/) and make sure you're logged in as the administrator of your development tenant. Click "Azure Active Directory" 1️⃣ and then "App Registrations" 2️⃣.

![Return to your app registration](../../assets/03-001-AppRegistrationUpdate-1.png)

Select the app you registered earlier to view the application overview.

#### Add the M365 client applications

Click "Expose an API" 1️⃣ and then "+ Add a client application" 2️⃣.

![Open the Expose an API screen](../../assets/03-002-AppRegistrationUpdate-2.png)

Paste the ID for the Teams mobile or desktop app, `1fec8e78-bce4-4aaf-ab1b-5451cc387264` into the flyout 1️⃣ and check the scope you created earlier 2️⃣ to allow Teams to issue tokens for that scope. Then click "Add application" 3️⃣ to save your work.

Repeat the process for the Teams web application, `5e3ce6c0-2b1f-4285-8d4b-75ee78787346`.

### Project set up
- Clone or download the sample from [https://github.com/OfficeDev/m365-msteams-northwind-app-samples](https://github.com/OfficeDev/m365-msteams-northwind-app-samples)

- In a console, navigate to `src/extend-with-capabilities/ExtendTeamsForM365/` from the main folder `m365-msteams-northwind-app-samples`.

    ```bash
    cd src/extend-with-capabilities/ExtendTeamsForM365/
    ```

- Install modules

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
- Bot registration
Messaging extensions allow users to bring the application into a conversation in Teams. You can search data in your application, perform actions on them and send back results of your interaction to your application as well as Teams to display all results in a rich card in the conversation.

Since it is a conversation between your application's web service and teams, you'll need a secure communication protocol to send and receive messages like the **Bot Framework**'s messaging schema.

You'll need to [register your web service as a bot in the Bot Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=userassigned) and update the app manifest file to define your web service so Teams client can know about it.

You will also need the Bot id and secret for env file.

You'll need to add Outlook and Teams channel in the bot configuration.
You'll also need to specify the Originator in the env file, which can be done using this [document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/security-requirements).


- Run ngrok - point to port 3978

    ```bash
    ngrok http -host-header=rewrite 3978
    ```

- Update the `.env` configuration 

Update the env file with the below values:

```
COMPANY_NAME=Northwind Traders
PORT=3978

TEAMS_APP_ID=<any GUID>
HOSTNAME=<Your ngrok url>
TENANT_ID=<Your tenant id>
CLIENT_ID=<client id from AAD app registration>
CLIENT_SECRET=<client secret from AAD app registration>
CONTACTS=<Any user/users you'd like to chat/mail for orders. Comma separated if more than one user>
BOT_REG_AAD_APP_ID=88888888-0d02-43af-85d7-72ba1d66ae1d
BOT_REG_AAD_APP_PASSWORD=111111vk
ORIGINATOR=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```
### Create Northwind DB local files
